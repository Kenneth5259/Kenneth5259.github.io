This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Latest Update
  The live deployment has been retired for a wordpress site. Wordpress was a faster way to implement CMS for Blog and Portfolio Posts


## My Portfolio Website

Hello! My name is Kenneth Carroll and this is the site that is meant to serve as my personal web portfolio by showing off projects I have worked on, being a platform to distribute both an interactive and downloadable resume, and provide access to my software related social medias.


## How it is built and hosted

Every components, save Font Awesome Icons, was styled directly without any 3rd party react libraries.

The site started as vanilla HTML/CSS/JS but I've been working alot in react and figured it'd be more fun to handle responsiveness that way. Thanks to the npm package gh-pages, it is still hosted on gituhub pages but is redirected to my custom domain and gets SSL from firebase. It also opens me up to possibly creating a small server and database for my projects if I get tired of hard coding each projects data into the app.

## Where do I want to go with it?

Currently only the about me page, navbar, and portfolio page are working. After my Algorithms and Data Structures exam ends on 10/11/2020 I plan to add in the testimonials page and a readable version of my resume. My resume is downloadbale though. As sson as those pages are complete I plan to include mobile device support and possibly tablet support to keep the expoerience as close to seamless across multiple devices as possible.

I also plan to integrate Form Spark into the contact me button as a way to manage user contact, and possibly integrating a blog w/ CMS around new years.

Once the key functionality is finished (i.e missing pages and contact), I plan to add animation and transitions between components. Progress on the site is slower than I'd like but I am also working on a react-native machine learning based project that will move from private to public repository once the main functionality is completed.
